the instructor during the session was Mr. shaurya sinha (Data Analyst Intern at jio). i got to
learn a lot during these 7 days and it was an amazing experience learning with SHAPEAI.

<br> i got to have hands on experience on:
<li>python
<li>machine learning
<li>tensorflow
<br>during these 7 days, and everything was explained from the very basics so that
anyone with zero experience on programming can learn.
I enjoyed these 7 days, you can as well.To register for next free days bootcamp, visit;
